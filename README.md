# Portfolio

The purpose of this repository is to represent a set of modules that reflect the way I write code.
To examine these modules, simply look in the “Assets/Scripts” file directory, following the instructions below.

I have created all the folders in this directory in a modular fashion, using “Assembly Definition” to make it easier to clearly distinguish between modules.
I have numbered them to facilitate the order of review.
The larger the number, the more complex and interdependent the modules are.
At number 4, I created a skill system as well as a structure to follow a customizable command chain using the Command Pattern at the beginning of the game.
These modules can be upgraded during game development and various structures can be built on top of them, which can change from game to game.
              
Features;
ECS_MonoB_Hybrid_Minimap - no need for second camera.

Utility can be used by all modules, so it is kept separate.

Third party Assets used;

- Odin Inspector and Serializer
- DOTween Pro
